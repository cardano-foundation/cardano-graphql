## Overview

Cross-platform, _typed_, and **queryable** API service for Cardano, powered by 
[Hasura](https://hasura.io/) to precisely query projected Cardano state from 
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

The [schema](src/schema.graphql) is defined in native `.graphql`, and used to generate 
[packages](generated_packages/README.md) for internal and client-side static typing. 
[Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) exposes the NodeJS execution 
engine over a HTTP endpoint, and includes support for open source metrics via Prometheus, 
and operation whitelisting.

A [CLI](./cli/README.md) aims to streamline the setup and deployment process.

**GraphQL** is a query language and execution environment with server and client implementations
 across many programming languages. The language can be serialized for network transmission, 
 schema implementations hashed for assurance, and is suited for describing most domains.
 
**TypeScript** (and JS) has the largest pool of production-ready libraries, developers, and 
interoperability in the GraphQL and web ecosystem in general. TypeScript definitions for the 
schema, generated by [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com), are available 
on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cardano-graphql-ts).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:input-output-hk/cardano-graphql.git
$ cd cardano-graphql
```

2. Start `cardano-node`, `cardano-db-sync-extended`, `postgresql` and `cardano-graphql` components using Docker:

```
$ NETWORK=testnet docker-compose up
```

3. Query the API once fully synced :tada:

```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "{ cardano { blockHeight }}"}' http://localhost:3100/graphql
```

For more information, have a look at the [Wiki :book:](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-graphql/wiki).
