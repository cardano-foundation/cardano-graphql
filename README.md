# Cardano GraphQL
[![Build Status](https://jenkins.daedalus-operations.com/buildStatus/icon?job=cardano-graphql%2Fmaster)](https://jenkins.daedalus-operations.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/cardano-graphql/)

Cross-platform, _typed_, and **queryable** API service for Cardano, powered by 
[Hasura](https://hasura.io/) to precisely query projected Cardano state from 
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

The [schema](src/schema.graphql) is defined in native `.graphql`, and used to generate 
[packages](generated_packages/README.md) for internal and client-side static typing. 
[Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) exposes the NodeJS execution 
engine over a HTTP endpoint.

A [CLI](./cli/README.md) aims to streamline the setup and deployment process.

**GraphQL** is a query language and execution environment with server and client implementations
 across many programming languages. The language can be serialized for network transmission, 
 schema implementations hashed for assurance, and is suited for describing most domains.
 
**TypeScript** (and JS) has the largest pool of production-ready libraries, developers, and 
interoperability in the GraphQL and web ecosystem in general. TypeScript definitions for the 
schema, generated by [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com), are available 
on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cardano-graphql-ts).
